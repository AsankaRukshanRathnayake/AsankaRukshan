                    </div>

                    <div class="blog_article">

                        <p class="article_para">Data means row facts which describes about people, things, procedures, and events. In various situations, these raw data are needed to process into beneficial information. In that case people use computer technology. Earlier, data was limited to numbers, characters, and symbols, however nowadays it varies to complex types of data such as music, video, audio, and photographs. We need to create, access, manage, and search data in a productive, time saving, and understandable way. For this purpose, people use databases and database management software.</p>

                        <p class="article_para">Basically, a database is collection of organized or structured data which are integrated in a logical manner. Databases are useful for sharing and securing data and the supports data integrity and minimize data redundancy. Usually, databases contain tables which are consisted of logically related records. Each record consisted of fields that describes attributes of relevant entities. Fields are formed using characters which are the most basic element of databases. Databases are used in individual, organizational, commercial, and distributed purposes. Database Management Systems (DBMS) are software which allows working with databases efficiently. There are several database models such as relational, multidimensional, network, object oriented, and hierarchical. Microsoft Access which is one of the most commonly used DBMS software is an example for relational database model. It allows linking related information using tables.  MySQL, Oracle Database, Apache Cassandra, LibreOffice Base, PostgreSQL, DBeaver and Sybase are few of other available DBMS applications. Here we are focusing about features, uses, pros and cons of three applications of above mentioned.</p>

                        <p class="article_section_title">MICROSOFT ACCESS</p>

                        <p class="article_para">The current version is available with Microsoft Office 365, however Microsoft office versions 2010, 2016, and 2019 are also in use. This application software was developed by Microsoft Cooperation and initially launched in 1992. Microsoft Access is a relational database management system; it allows to link related information or data. MS Access is used in business, office, schools, workplaces, and even by programmers to make their activities easier. However, it mainly targets on Windows Operating System.</p>

                        <p class="article_para">MS access is easy to install and operate however, it is not free of charge. Microsoft cooperation allows you to enjoy a trial period before permanently subscribe your package. But it offers free access for selected purposes such as academic activities for both students, undergraduates, and teachers. Even you can use MS Access in cloud without installing into your PC. It has the capability to interact with information stored in other database applications and other types of applications such as spreadsheets and word processing formats. Its source code is not available for the user. It provides objects such as tables, Queries, macros, forms, reports, and modules.</p>

                        <p class="article_para">Since 2007, MS access use .accdb file extension. It supports graphical user interface and offers a considerable amount of storage for data. We are able to use multiple templates which are available within the program and Microsoft’s website.  The productivity and performance is higher and users can experience their work with fewer   errors. It provides ability to secure your information with encrypting and password protection.</p>

                        <p class="article_para">MS access is suitable for personal use and it may cause limitations for multiple users. Even though data in GBs of capacity can be stored, there are limitations. There can be some security concerns and critical transactions can become difficult to capture. MS Access facilitates only MS windows and MacOS, therefore, it cannot be suggested for Linux and other platform environments. A basic training is required for working with MS Access.</p>

                        <p class="article_para">Since its user friendliness, MS Access have spread all around the world.</p>

                        <p class="article_section_title">LibreOffice Base<p>

                        <p class="article_para">LibreOffice Base is one of the competitors for MS Access which was developed by Document Foundation and firstly released in October 2011. Unlike MS access, it is a free and Open-Source software. It is also a relational database manager.</p>

                        <p class="article_para">LibreOffice Base allows you to access, create, modify, and view data and information stored in databases. It also supports graphical user interface and available with LibreOffice office suit. Unlike MS Access it supports multiple platforms including Linux, Window and MacOS. It has the ability to import and link the information stored in other DBMS applications such as MySQL, MS Access, and PostgreSQL. It is also fully integrated with other LibreOffice Applications including LibreOffice Writer and Calc. LibreOffice online was launched in 2020, allowing users to enjoy Base online.</p>

                        <p class="article_para">LibreOffice Base provides tables, queries, forms, and reports. It is best for single person use. LibreOffice is fast and flexible. One of the main advantages is its cross-platform functionality.</p>

                        <p class="article_section_title">MySQL</p>

                        <p class="article_para">MySQL is also an Open-Source, relational, Cross-Platform, free DBMS application. It was initially developed by MySQL AB and launched in 1995. In 2008, Sun Microsystems acquired MySQL AB and later, in 2010, Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle Corporation. MySQL has lost its parental inventors by now.</p>

                        <p class="article_para">“SQL” stands for 'Structured Query Language'. MySQL is also a user-friendly DBMS application. It supports Graphical User Interface. We can download and install MySQL free of charge under GNU License. Since it supports multiple platforms, MySQL can be used in various Operating Systems such as Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Solaris, and FreeBSD. It is fast and flexible which supports large number of embedded applications. It allows high-capacity data in GBs, however efficiency become law when the data or file size increases. As same as MS Access, it is unable to handle transactions efficiently. It does not include better developing and debugging tools compared to other databases. However, when we consider about data security, its approach is comparatively higher so that many e-commerce businesses and social media sites take advantage from MySQL. In addition to that, MySQL is compatible with PHP which is a language used in web developing. Its speed is comparatively high, therefore, it can be used easily for even large data sets.</p>
